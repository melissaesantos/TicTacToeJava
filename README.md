# Tic-Tac-Toe README

# Description:
This project is an implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java, utilizing the Swing library for GUI components. The game allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to successfully align three of their marks either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all spaces on the board are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

# Functionality:

Game Board: The game board consists of a 3x3 grid of buttons where players can place their marks.

Player Turns: Players take turns placing their marks on empty spaces on the board.

Win Detection: The game detects when a player has won by aligning three of their marks either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Tie Detection: If all spaces on the board are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

Restart: Players can restart the game at any time by clicking the "Restart" button.

# Usage:

Run the TicTacToe.java file.

The game window will appear, displaying the Tic-Tac-Toe board and indicating whose turn it is.

Click on any empty space on the board to place your mark (X or O).

Continue taking turns until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.

To restart the game at any time, click the "Restart" button located at the bottom of the window.

# Dependencies:
This project utilizes the Swing library for GUI components, which is included in the Java Development Kit (JDK)
